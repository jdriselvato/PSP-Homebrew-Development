# PSP Controls 2

This example displays text on the screen when a button is pressed on the device. This one is more dynamic instead of hard coding each print statement.

Because we are using a dictionary, we can actually get mutliple presses. 

So `square + triangle + up + down` can display at the same time, unlike the first controls example.

There does seem to be a limitation on how many buttons are registered at the same time. This maybe a limitation to Euphoria to note or it maybe a limitation to the PSP.
