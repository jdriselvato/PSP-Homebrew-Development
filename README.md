## Examples

1. PSP Controls 1 - prints button pressed on the PSP.
2. PSP Controls 2 - prints button pressed on the PSP dynamically.
2. Sprite follow - a simple app that shows drawing two spites. One sprite is controlled by the player, the second sprite follows the player with a simple algo.


## Customizing the eboot

While initially testing LuaPlayer Euphoria v7 on PPSSPP, I became annoyed at the fact that every eboot has the same icon and the PPSSPP display doesn't make it obvious which icon is the one I'm working with.

In this section I'll document how to change the eboot icon and eboot display name.

Nearly every tool to do this works on Windows. If I remember correctly, when I was super into PSP development when the life-cycle was still active, I had to use wine on my Mac.

In my case, I'm going to use PSPBPacker on my physical PSP to edit the icon. 

If you have windows, I recommend [POPstation GUI](https://wololo.net/downloads/index.php/download/8163).
