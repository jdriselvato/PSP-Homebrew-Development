-------------------- What is LuaPlayer Euphoria ? --------------

LuaPlayer Euphoria is a branch of LuaPlayer that is optimised for speed, Whilst staying true to 
the ease of use and function names we have all grown to love.

-------------------- What can it do? What makes it different to the normal LuaPlayer ? -------------------

It can display images up to 100% faster than 
the default LuaPlayer, by automatically swizzling the images as there loaded. You can also unSwizzle images and move
image to Vram for faster rendering.

It also features IntraFont support, so you can now load and display fonts without the horrible slowdown that the built in one brings ;)
Go to the tools folder and try out the ttf > pgf font converter :) 

Normal ttf font support has being dropped, due to the slow speed. IntraFont with converted TTF's is the way to go.

Another feature LuaPlayer Euphoria has is Automatic TV-OUT support for your Lua Scripts!, just go to Settings > Connected Display Settings on your PSP and set the output
to your tv, then launch your lua game/app and wala! Your game/app is displayed on your tv in all it's glory!

It also features Mp3, Ogg & At3 playback via the PSP Media Engine. 
Whilst displaying a 480x272 image and playing a Mp3 file, LuaPlayer Euphoria can achieve 
up to 220>250 FPS (Frames Per Second) running at only 222mhz!. (SEE SAMPLE DEMO FOR PROOF!)

It also features CPU Speed control. Which can be done by the user. So you can set the PSP's CPU to either : 100, 222, 266 or 333mhz.

A big feature is it's VFPU math library. Using the VFPU math functions can really speed up your game/app if you are using a lot
of maths.

Another feature, albeit trivial, is a built in FPS Function. By simply calling "showFPS()" you can see your game/applications 
current FPS out of 60 frames. If you want to see its "True" FPS, comment out screen.waitVblankStart and change pad = Controls.Read() to pad = Controls.ReadPeek() (doesn't cap FPS)- as these
cap the framerate to 60. 

+ A lot more to come!

It is slim and phat compatible. Should work on 3.0>5.xx firmwares. Should also work
on chickHen.

------------------- Why use this over PGE or LuaPlayer HM ? ------------------------

Well thats a good question. If you don't like the way PGE lua or LuaPlayer HM are set up (ie function names, calls)
and prefer the old lua player in that sense (just not the performance), then LuaPlayer Euphoria is the answer
you have been looking for.

------------------- Are we going to see more in the future ? ---------------------------

Provided there is genuine interest from a decent sized group of people then yes. I wont be doing this
for the good of my health... lol.

So yeah, if there are enough people using it, and enough people interested in the project I will keep working on it.
I will also try my best to add any new features you desire.
