-- If you find a bug with LuaPlayer Euphoria, Please submit to the official forums : http://www.retroemu.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=148 or on the google code page : http://code.google.com/p/luaplayereuphoria/
-- Based on LuaPlayer v0.20 by Shine --
-- Official forums : http://www.retroemu.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=148

---SCREEN---

screen:blit(x, y, image, [alpha], [source x], [source y], [width], [height]) -- Added optional alpha level variable.
-- usage is optional when just using (screen:blit(x, y, image), but when using sourcex/y you must set the alpha value.
-- The reason it's there is so you can easilly fade images in/out.
screen:slowClear() -- If your having problems with the screen not clearing correctly and cannot fix it, I suggest you use this. (Note : It is slower than using the standard screen:clear() so only use if there is no alternative)

---IMAGE---
Image.free(Image) -- free an image.
Image.swizzle(Image) -- Swizzle an Image (only after unswizzling! as images are auto swizzled by default).
Image.unSwizzle(Image) -- UnSwizzle an Image.
Image.toVram(Image) -- Move an image to Vram (only moves it to vram if there is enough space available).

---SYSTEM---

-- functions
System.draw() 													-- Start the GU (MUST BE CALLED BEFORE ANY GRAPHICS BLITTING)
System.endDraw() 												-- End the GU (MUST BE CALLED AT THE END OF ANY GRAPHICS BLITTING)
System.setCpuSpeed(number) 										-- Set the Cpu speed. Options : 100, 222, 266, 333.
System.showFPS() 												-- Show the current FPS.
System.quit() 													-- Exit back to the XMB.

---Controls---

Controls.ReadPeek() -- Same as Controls.Read() except it doesn't cap the Framerate to 60FPS


---VFPU MATH---

Now linked to the default lua math functions. (makes more sense)

----AUDIO-----
Supported formats : Mp3, At3, Ogg & Wav. All formats (except Wav) playback using the PSP Media Engine.

Channels : 

Mp3, At3 & Ogg files have a maxiumum of 2 channels each (per format) to use. The channels you may use range from 0 > 1 (2 channels).
If you try to load or play a Mp3 in a channel over the maximum value, lua will return an error.

Wav files have a maxiumum of 30 channels to use. The channels you may use range from 0 > 30. 
If you try to load or play a Wav in a channel over the maximum value, lua will return an error.
