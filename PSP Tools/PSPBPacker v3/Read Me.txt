Hello everyone,
welcome to PSPBPacker.

This is a lua based app that edits eboots for the PSP and PSP Go.

This is a useful tool to use if you do not like something about any
of your eboots.

You can add, change or remove anything from the eboot which includes
the following:

Title -Change only
Parental level - Add and change and remove
App Version - Add and change and remove
ICON0.PNG -Add, change and remove
ICON1.PMF -Add, change and remove
PIC0.PNG -Add, change and remove
PIC1.PNG -Add, change and remove
SND0.AT3 -Add, change and remove
DATA.PSP -Add, change and remove
DATA.PSAR -Add, change and remove
MEMSIZE -Add and remove

MEMSIZE will unlock extra RAM for the PSP slim only.

It is NOT recommended to add, change, or remove the DATA.PSP
or DATA.PSAR, unless you know what you're doing.
You can backup, restore and unpack the eboot in the Eboot Menu.

To restore an eboot that you have backed up, go to the eboot that you
have edited and press X to go into the Eboot Menu, then Press X on the
"Restore eboot" option.

You can open up eboots in the browser as if they're folders to view the
contents inside. You can also select the files inside the eboot to copy
from one eboot to another, you can even copy files from the eboot you
are editing.
For example,
press X on the PIC1.PNG option in the eboot menu, then open up the
eboot in the browser by pressing X, then select _PIC0.PNG or _ICON0.PNG.
Then save changes.

Installation:
Copy the "PSPBPacker" folder into the "/PSP/GAME" folder or the
"/PSP/GAMExxx" folder corresponding to the CFW that you are on.
Once you have done that it is ready to run.

Enjoy.
